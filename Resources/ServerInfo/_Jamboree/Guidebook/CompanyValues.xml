  # SUBSECTION 2: Company Values
  [bolditalic]Your behaviour reflects upon the company. A productive employee is a profitable one.[/bolditalic]
  \n

  [bold]Respect for Corporate Property[/bold]: All tools, equipment, and materials are the exclusive
  property of NanoTrasen. Willful damage, misuse, or theft will result in, at minimum, the total cost
  of the item being garnished from your current and future pay cycles.
  \n

  [bold]Inter-Departmental Synergy[/bold]: Your department is one cog in a vast, profitable machine. You
  are expected to interface with other departments in a professional and efficient manner.
  Departmental feuds and personal grievances that impede workflow are a drain on resources
  and will not be tolerated.
  \n

  [bold]Professional Behavior[/bold]: While NanoTrasen recognizes the need for morale-building
  activities, behavior that actively disrupts the work environment is forbidden. This includes, but is
  not limited to: public intoxication outside of designated recreational zones, un-sanctioned
  violence, and the unauthorized modification of your own biology or station equipment.
  Remember: a happy worker is a productive worker, but a disciplined worker is a reliable one.
