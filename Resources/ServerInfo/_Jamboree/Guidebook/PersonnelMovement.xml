  # and Visitors
\n

  ## Demotion Procedure
  - Demotions cannot be performed without authorization from the relevant Head of Staff or
  the Captain.
  - Personnel are to report to the Head of Personnel for demotion.
  - After a demotion order is given to the person being demoted (e.g: by radio, in person,
  etc.), that person is no longer considered a member of that department. Security may
  take further actions if the person does not fully comply.

  Causes for Demotion (This list is not all encompassing, but merely provides key
  examples)
  - Any major violation
  - Critical incompetence in their position.
  - Creating an unsafe or abusive work environment.
  - Neglecting a given job for more than 30 minutes at a time.

  ## Hiring/Transferring Procedure
  - No new hires or transfers are permitted without contacting the relevant Head of
  Staff/Acting Head of Staff. If one is not available, the Captain is to utilize their best
  judgement.
  - Promotion to Acting Head of Staff requires authorization by the Captain or Acting
  Captain.
  - All new hires to the Security department, or Acting Heads of Staff, are to be
  mindshielded and searched for contraband prior to official employment.

  ## Visitor Procedure
  - The Captain may grant or deny requests to dock at their discretion.
  - Visitors may be assigned an escort or searched upon entrance at the Captain’s
  discretion.
  - Visitors aboard an NanoTrasen station are subject to the Legal Mandate. If a violation is
  made by a visitor who then flees in their vehicle, Security are allowed to board the
  visitor’s ship to detain them.
