  ## Arresting Procedure

  Arresting procedure is the ideal way to carry out an arrest. Not all can or will be performed this
  way, but they should generally follow this procedure.

  1. Inform the criminal that they are wanted, and why they are wanted. This is void if they
  are visibly armed or in the process of committing a crime.

  2. If compliant, cuff and transport the prisoner to the brig immediately without harming them
  and allow the warden, HoS, or Captain to complete the sentencing. If there is no warden,
  HoS, or Captain, the arresting officer may complete sentencing. If compliant, you do not
  need to stun the criminal/suspect before applying cuffs. If the violation is minor then the
  suspect may be allowed to walk freely to security while accompanied by a security
  member until that liberty is abused.

  3. If resistant, use your nonlethal weaponry until a situation prompts the use of lethal force.
  If successful, transport the prisoner to the brig and allow the warden, HoS, or Captain to
  complete sentencing. If there is no warden, HoS, or Captain, the arresting officer may
  complete sentencing.

  4. If lethal force is used, the suspect must be provided medical aid until they are in a stable
  enough condition to serve their sentence. If lethal force was used in the prevention of a
  capital offense, revival is no longer required.
