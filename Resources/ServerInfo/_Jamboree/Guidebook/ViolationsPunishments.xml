  # SUBSECTION 3: Violations, Punishment and Varieties

  Violations of the Legal Mandate come in 4 Categories: Minor, Moderate, Major, and Capital.
  Each category comes with example violations and a recommended punishment type. Though
  the list is extensive, some possible violations do not have a listing in this document. It is up to
  the Warden and Head of Security of the station to deem the category of violations which are not
  described in examples. Some violations override each other, such as how Murder overrides
  Manslaughter.

  confinement (A.K.A Perma)[/italic]
