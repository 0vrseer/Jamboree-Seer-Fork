  2. Objectives are not required

  Objectives are suggestions. Antagonists are free to ignore them if they have a
  preferred or more interesting idea for their course of action.

  - For Nuclear Operatives, however, it is strongly suggested to follow
    objectives.

  Antagonist actions do not have to be nefarious or evil, but should make an effort to
  influence the story and shift in a meaningful way.
