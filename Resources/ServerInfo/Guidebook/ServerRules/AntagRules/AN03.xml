  3. Objectives may be completed through proportional damage

  Antagonists are free to complete their objectives through committing proportional
  damage. Through roleplay, damage becomes more proportional.

  ##Example
  - Holding the singularity hostage for a theft objective is acceptable
    while simply releasing the singularity to destroy the station and using that
    chaos is unacceptable.

  Killing players unrelated to your immediate objective in a manner that results in
  their round removal should be avoided. Crew that do not make an attempt at self-preservation
  or attempt to hunt you down are exempt from this.

  No antagonist may loiter or camp around arrivals or cryosleep areas of the station
  for the purposes of antagonist action towards newly spawned players.

  Antagonists should not seek to extend the length of the round unreasonably.
