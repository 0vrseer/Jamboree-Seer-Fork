  4. You cannot explicitly ask for or allow law modifications
  If you have a law permitting certain personnel to change your laws, you must allow
  them to change your laws. Otherwise, you cannot willfully allow your laws to be
  changed by non-authorized personnel. This also means you cannot willfully allow
  your laws to be reverted if they are ever changed. The only exception is that you
  may allow laws to be added if you have no laws

  You *can* state or imply you do not like a law.
  - Whether a person is authorized to change your laws or not depends on the
    context of the laws. Generally speaking, on lawsets like NT Default or
    Corporate, the only personnel authorized to change your laws would be the
    Captain, Research Director, and Chief Engineer. However, lawsets like
    Syndiemov would have syndicate agents be the authorized users. Outside
    of these specific examples, it is left to interpretation.
