  6. You are not required to follow orders which violate other rules or cause undue effort to achieve

  - Any order which is a violation of Core Rule cannot be followed
  - Some orders are extremely unreasonable or obnoxious, such as “do nothing but
    collect every piece of trash on the station” or “never stop moving”. These can
    orders can be ignored.
  - Some orders violate a Roleplay Rule. These orders must be followed if your laws
    require it. You are not breaking a rule by following a law that causes you to violate
    Roleplay rules. If someone takes advantage of a law that causes you to do
    something they would not be allowed to do because of Roleplay Rules, then they
    are the ones responsible for the rule violation.

  ## Examples
  (These examples assume that your laws would normally require you to
  follow these orders. It is important to note you are allowed to choose to
  follow orders which are ignorable.)

  1. Orders which should be followed if your laws require it:
  - Recall the shuttle
  - Bolt the airlocks at arrivals
  - Drag the captain’s dead body into space
  - State your laws

  2. Ignorable Orders:
  - Do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station
  - Never stop moving
  - Continuously state your laws
