  1. Your silicon laws are your rules
  Silicon players are given a list of active laws. Each of these laws is effectively a
  roleplay rule that the character must follow. The primary differences between laws
  and actual rules are that the lawyering of laws is much more tolerated than the
  lawyering of rules, and that silicon laws are more dynamic than rules. Silicon laws
  can change during a round, and different characters have different laws, whereas
  everyone shares the same set of rules.

  - Lawyering refers to finding and exploiting loopholes, which are unintended
    but reasonable interpretations. The rules are written in an attempt to
    communicate intention, but silicon laws are written with the intention that
    loopholes become exploitable.
