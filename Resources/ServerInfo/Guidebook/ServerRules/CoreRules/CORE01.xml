0. Admin discretion on enforcement

## Subtext
1. Admins are allowed to disregard other rules should it prove beneficial for the shift
  experience or when it is in the best interest of the player base.

  Examples:
    - An admin can intervene during a situation where a player, regardless of
      antagonist status, has repeatedly delayed round-end when most other
      players are dead or wanting to leave.
    - An admin can intervene during a situation where a player, regardless of
      antagonist status, has habitually used the same strategies to cause mass
      death or destruction to the detriment of the rest of the serverâ€™s
      experience.
    - An admin may mirror bans from other servers at their discretion.
    - An admin may ban accounts linked to use of proxies, CID randomizers,
      DLL use, or other similar things at their discretion.
    - An admin may ask players in possession of multiple alt accounts to
      choose one to play on and ban the other accounts.

  Regularly coming close to breaking the rules without technically breaking them
  will be treated as the rules being broken.
