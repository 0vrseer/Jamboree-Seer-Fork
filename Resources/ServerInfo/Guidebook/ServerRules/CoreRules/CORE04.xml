  3. Metagaming is expressly prohibited

  ## Subtext
  - Metacomms, the use of methods of communication outside SS14 IC, is a
    serious rule violation that may be met with voucher bans for all real life
    accounts. If players are sharing the same IP or know each other in real life or
    the like, inform the admins first as failure to do so will look suspicious. Players
    are allowed to introduce new players that they know to the game but all
    communication and explanations should be done in game if possible. Admins
    can also help in these situations if requested.

  - Streaming of the server is allowed. However, if there is any indication that the
    stream is being used in a metagame, such as a player watching the stream to
    gain information about the round, it will be treated as metacomms and dealt
    with accordingly.

  - Characters are allowed to have persistent knowledge/relationships/friendships
    with the following caveats:
      -- Such knowledge doesnâ€™t violate the Metashield.
      -- Knowledge of a character being an antagonist from a previous round is
         not used maliciously.
      -- Character friendships/relationships/rivalries are not exploitative in
         nature or used to gain an unfair advantage. Having an IC friendship with
         another player does not justify, for example, giving them all-access each
         round. It also does not justify firing a player every round because you
         have an IC rivalry with said character
