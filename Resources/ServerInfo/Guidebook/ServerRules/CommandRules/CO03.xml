  3. Deal with enemies in proportion to their crime(s)

  - Restricted antagonists (and/or crewmembers) are to be handled in proportion to
    their committed crimes. The decision to execute an antagonist should have good
    in-character reasoning based on their crimes and the state of the shift. More
    information on this can be found in the Code of Conduct.
