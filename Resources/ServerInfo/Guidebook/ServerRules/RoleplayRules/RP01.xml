  1. Roleplay

  ## Subtext
  ### You must roleplay. Your character’s actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game
      should be solely based on your character’s experiences rather than your own.

    - Act in character throughout the round. Whether or not you do
      something should be based on whether or not it makes sense for your
      character to do it.
    - Actions that have no regard for your character or setting are
      acceptable, but need to be within reason and limited. You are permitted
      to roleplay insanity, but doing so at the expense of others experiences
      is not acceptable.
    - Being an antagonist does not allow you to stop playing a character.
      Determine how your character would react to being given these
      objectives and work through it appropriately.
    - Do not annoy other players without a roleplay or IC reason.
    - As a non-sentient or partially-sentient character, you are expected to
      have only a limited understanding of space stations and their
      mechanics.

  ### Follow the naming convention rules
    - Character names must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
    - Names which break the immersion of the game (such as, but not solely,
      names that are just real world or already existing fictional characters)
      are not permitted.
