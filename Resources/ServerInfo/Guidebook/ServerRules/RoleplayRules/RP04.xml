  3. Do not Powergame
  Powergaming is using an in-game mechanic or game knowledge to give your
  own character an advantage at the expense of everyone else. Powergaming can
  take several forms, but is generally rooted in playing to win or focusing on
  playing the game instead of roleplay. Playing your character should always be
  more important than playing the game.

  - Cool things that have a side benefit of player-character empowerment
  or just cool methods of empowering your character are acceptable
  when done sparingly. If done to a point to where it becomes a detriment
  to the server, action will be taken.
