  7. Do not self antag
  As a crew member on the space station, you are allied with Nanotrasen and the
  station as a whole from the start of the round

  - Do not act like an antagonist if you are not one
  - Willfully assisting known antagonists is self-antagonism.
      Leeway is given in the cases of bribes, coercion, or other
      forms of duress.
  - Actively seeking conversion or transformation into an antagonist is
    considered self-antag.
  - Clowns, Mimes, and theatrical roles are expected to entertain the crew
    and should not be committing regular felonies to do so.
  - End-of-round griefing (EORG) is not allowed. This includes attacking,
    destroying, and severely injuring without reason both at and on the way
    to Central Command. Remember, you are playing a character
    throughout the round. Our roleplay standards do not evaporate at
    Central Command.
