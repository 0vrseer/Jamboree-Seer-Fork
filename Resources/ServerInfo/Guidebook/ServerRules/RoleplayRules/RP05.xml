  5. Play a believable character
  - Space Station 14 is a space opera parody. You are on a space station that
    employs clowns and mimes, has cargo gorillas, people eating deep-fried clothes,
    and sometimes thereâ€™s a dozen Captains. Your character should fit within this
    game world.
  - Infantile characters should be avoided, whilst silly characters should be
    roleplayed properly. There is a good chance your character still wants to have a
    job at the end of the day, so you should probably act like it.
